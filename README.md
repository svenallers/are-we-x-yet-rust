# Are we X yet? (Rust)

This list provides an overview of "Are we X yet?" sites existing for Rust. The list is mainly based on pages coming from [Mozilla-Wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Areweyet), which is probably a way better source of truth then this site is. Sadly there is no option to filter for Rust related sites. That is why this page was created.

## Sites

The sites listed are sorted alphabetically.

- [Are we async yet?](https://areweasyncyet.rs/) — Development progress of async/await syntax in Rust
- [Are we audio yet?](https://areweaudioyet.com/) — Audio related development in Rust
- [Are we game yet?](http://arewegameyet.com/) — Game development in Rust
- [Are we GUI yet?](http://areweguiyet.com/) — User interfaces in Rust
- [Are we (I)DE yet?](http://areweideyet.com/) — Text editors and IDE support
- [Are we learning yet?](http://www.arewelearningyet.com/) — Machine learning in Rust
- [Are we web yet?](http://arewewebyet.org/) — Web development in Rust


## Acknowledgement

Even though only [Mozilla-Wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Areweyet) was mentioned in the first section, there were multiple sources used to create the list:

- [Mozilla-Wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Areweyet)
- [Awesome-Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust) which is also an awesome page to find interesting frameworks and libraries for Rust in general

Thanks to all contributing to those sites. Without you I would not have any startpoint to create this list at all.

Of course I would also thank all people maintaining all those cool "Are we X yet?" pages. They give a really nice overview about certain topics in the Rust ecosystem, what makes it way easier for people to evaluated on Rust based on those topics.

Not to forget all the people contributing to the Rust ecosystem in generall. You are the ones making the language what it currently is (awesome!).

## Contribution

I am more than happy for everyone contributing to this list. Just edit the README and open a PR. It would also be nice to add your source (how you found it) to the PR, if you did not find it by yourself, to give the people sharing their knowledge some credit.
